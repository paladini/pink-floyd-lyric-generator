Daddy's flown across the ocean 
Leaving just a memory 
Snapshot in the family album 
Daddy what else did you leave for me? 
Daddy, what'd'ja leave behind for me?!? 
All in all it was just a brick in the wall. 
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall.  
"You! Yes, you behind the bikesheds, stand still
lady!"
When we grew up and went to school
There were certain teachers who would
Hurt the children in any way they could
(oof!)
By pouring their derision
Upon anything we did
And exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kids
But in the town it was well known
When they got home at night, their fat and
Psychopathic wives would thrash them
Within inches of their lives.
