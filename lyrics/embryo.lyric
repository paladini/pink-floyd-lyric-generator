All is love, is all I am
a ball is all I am
I'm so new compared to you
and I am very small
Warm glow, moon bloom
always need a little more room
waiting here seems like years
never seen the light of day
All around I hear strange sounds
come gurgling in my ear
red the light and dark the night
I feel my dawn is near
Warm glow, moon bloom
always need a little more room
whisper low, here I go
I will see the sunshine show
