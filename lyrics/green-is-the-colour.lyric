Heavy hung the canopy of blue
shade my eyes and I can see you
white is the light that shines trough the dress that you wore
She lay in the shadow of a wave
hazy were the visions overplayed
sunlight in her eyes, but moonshine made her cry every time
Green is the colour of her kind
quickness of the eye deceives the mind
envy is the bond between the hopeful and the damned
