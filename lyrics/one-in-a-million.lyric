Would you like to be one in a million?
Would you like to be one in five?
Would you like to know all the hidden meanings?
Before they tell you that you've run out of time
Would you like to be one in a million?
Would you like to be one in five?
When they tell you that you ain't going nowhere
When they tell you that you can't live your life
