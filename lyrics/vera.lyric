"Where the hell are you?"
"Over 47 german planes were destroyed with the loss of only 15 of our own aircraft"
"Where the hell are you Simon?"
[Machine gun sound, followed by plane crashing]
Does anybody here remember Vera Lynn
Remember how she said that
We would meet again
Some sunny day 
Vera! Vera!
What has become of you
Does anybody else in here
Feel the way I do ?
